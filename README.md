# Data Mining project: Quantitative analysis of US Open (golf) over 4 years

Author: Adrien ROBILIARD

### Introduction
The aim of this project was to analyse golf players’ performances from different variables at US Open tournaments over 4 years. Different aspects of a “data project” were developed here: web scrapping, data preprocessing, data exploration, storytelling, machine learning and data visualisation.

### Repository content: 
-	Report: “Compte_rendu_Projet_Golf” (written in French), where implementations are detailed, results interpreted, and limitations discussed.
-	Appendices: “Annexe” containing visualisation outputs: graphs, tables, pictures.
-	Code: “Project_Data_Mining” (Jupyter Notebook, Python 3)

### Programming with Python 3: 

Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, BeautifulSoup, Scikit-learn 

### Data: 

Personal golf players’ data (weight, age, nationality, height) and performances data (final ranking, average driving distance, precision at hitting fairways, average strokes at par 3/4/5/putting …). You can take a look at the “Annexe” PDF file where all variables are mentioned and described. 

### Main parts:

**Getting and Preprocessing data**
- Scrapping from the Statistics page of the PGA website (https://www.pgatour.com/stats.html)
-	Cleaning

**Exploratory analysis & storytelling:**
-	Statistics
-	Correlations
-	Graphics

**Machine Learning algorithms:**
-	Clustering (players’ profiles)
-	Regression (driving distance, ranking …) & Dimension Reduction (PCA)
-	Classification: Knn & decision trees (prediction of top 3/10)

Results are available in the notebook as well as in the “Annexe” file (they are also detailed and discussed in the report in French).
